# PopDrawers

Is your Blender screen too cluttered? Do you have areas open that you only need to access to click or copy data once every few minutes?

PopDrawers allows you to focus on your main area (currently 3D Viewport and Text Editor) while retaining quick and easy access to other areas that you may need.

eg. 3D Viewport - You are editing a mesh and you realize that you need to make a change to the Shader/Geometry node tree. Rather than switching areas or workspaces, now you can quickly pop open the node editor you need at the bottom of the screen, then close it again. No menu navigation, no click and drag area separation/combination. Same goes for the Timeline: Rather than taking up a sliver at the bottom of your screen, now you can easily open and close it whenever you need to make a change.

eg. Text Editor - While writing scripts I often want as much vertical space as possible, however, working with the Console and Info areas, it can be difficult to read long lines in a vertical layout. Now, you can close the 3D Viewport, Console and Info views, have lots of room to read and write scripts, and have quick, easy access to those areas to copy/test scripts, and have them layed out horizontally, to make reading long lines much easier.
