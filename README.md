# PopDrawers

When editing text in Blender, it can be handy to have areas like Info, Console, Outliner, etc visible on screen to help with scripting. However, having all these open at once can lead to a cluttered screen that makes it difficult to read the scripts.

This addon allows you to maximize the Text area, while quickly popping open the other areas, and closing them again as soon as you've selected/copied/deleted etc.

Only works with 3.0 and up, they incorporated a new python command to close areas that this addon depends on.
